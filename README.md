## Abstract

### Objectives 

To evaluate geographic access to free weekly outdoor physical activity events (“parkrun”) in England, with a particular focus on deprived communities, and to identify 200 locations for future events to maximize geographic access to parkrun.


### Study design 

This study is a cross-sectional ecological analysis of the socioeconomic disparities in geographic access to parkrun events in England at the end of 2018.


### Methods 

We combined geo-location data on all English Lower Layer Super Output Areas and parkrun events to calculate geodesic distances to the nearest event for over 32,000 communities in England. We use this measure of geographic access to summarise the relationship between access and socioeconomic deprivation, measured using the Index of Multiple Deprivation. We then used geographic coordinates of public green spaces in England to conduct a simple location-allocation analysis to identify 200 locations for future event locations that would maximize access.


### Results 

In England 69% of the population live within 5 km of one of the 465 parkrun events. There is a small negative correlation between distance and deprivation, indicating that access is slightly better in more socioeconomically deprived areas. Setting up an additional 200 events in optimal locations would improve access: the average distance to the nearest parkrun event would improve by 1.22 km, from 4.65 km to 3.43 km, and approximately 82% of the English population would live within 5 km of a parkrun event. 


### Conclusions

Over two thirds of the English population live within 5 km of a parkrun event, and contrary to our expectation, we find that geographic access is slightly better for those living in more deprived communities. Creating additional events may improve geographic access, but effective strategies will still be needed to increase engagement in new and existing events by those living in socioeconomically deprived areas.
